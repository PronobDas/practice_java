# One Away
There are three types of edits that can be performed on strings: 
1. insert a character, 
2. remove a character, or 
3. replace a character. 

Given two strings, write a function to check if they are
one edit (or zero edits) away.

EXAMPLE ->

pales, pale -> true

pale, bale -> true 

pale, bake -> false

pale, ple -> true
